## About this Tutorial

Quantum computing offers potential for significant leaps forward in computation to solve certain scientific problems, such as machine learning and chemistry simulation. There is, however, a continued need to be able to execute more complex quantum workloads, driven by algorithms that combine classical and quantum computation in the same execution cycle. This need from scientific applications drives fundamental changes in quantum execution architectures to enable efficient interactions between classical and quantum processors. In this tutorial, we will introduce users to the [Qiskit Runtime](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit-runtime), a new platform for describing workload execution at the level of programs rather than circuits. We will show users how to invoke Python program execution in a remote environment with low-latency interactions to quantum hardware. We will also show users how to solve tasks using a collection of pre-built programs. <br>

This tutorial targets developers and researchers who want to leverage quantum computing in their respective fields. In particular, those who are interested in learning how to execute quantum algorithms using Qiskit on the cloud and to create and deploy quantum programs as a service. We expect the typical attendee to have had exposure to programming in Python and some basic knowledge about Quantum Computing. Some familiarity with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) would also help.
